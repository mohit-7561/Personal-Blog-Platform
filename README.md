**A simple personal blog platform built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. This app allows users to register, log in, create posts, and view posts from others.**

## Backend (Node.js with Express):

- The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js.
- It provides RESTful APIs for user registration, login, creating posts, and fetching posts.
- MongoDB is used for data storage.
- Authentication is managed with JWT, and the backend is protected using middleware to validate tokens.
